# Open source Audits Toolkit

**OSAT** is a collection of tools created help you in your quest for a better website. All of these tools have been grouped into a single web app.

I've grown tired of SEO agencies making us pay hundreds of euros for simple tools. I decided to develop **OSAT** to help users find issues on their website and increase their SEO for free. 

After implementing the first features of **OSAT** I decided to introduced other features such as Security.

## Running

### Docker

```
## Dashboard

You can access the dashboard by going to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Config

If needed create a `.env` file with information that you would like to change

## Initialisation

### Create super admin
You need to create a superuser in order to get started. Type the following command

```Bash
docker-compose run osat_server python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Once this is done, you need to go to [localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin)

Connect using the super user that you have created.

### Create organization

You need to go to `Org -> Organization` and create a new organization. You can create as many as you want. Organization are used in order to implement RBAC in the project and only display information about an organization to users of this organization. Here is a quicklinkg to access it [http://localhost:8000/admin/org/website/](http://localhost:8000/admin/org/website/)


### Add user to organization

Once your organization is created. You need to add your user to this organization. 
Go to `Organizations -> Organizations Users` and add your user to the organization created before. [http://localhost:8000/admin/organizations/organizationuser/](http://localhost:8000/admin/organizations/organizationuser/)

### Create periodic task

We have implemented multiple periodic task in osat such as lighthouse audit and security audit. 
The parameters are all saved inside the DB. Therefore you need to instantiate your crawlers.

Go to `Periodic Tasks -> Periodic Tasks` and click on **ADD PERIODIC TASK**.

You need to create two periodick task:
- One for `lighthouse_crawler`
- One for `security_crawler` 

My settings for lighthouse and security are as follows

<p align="center"><img src="./docs/images/lighthouse-crawler.png" width="400px" /></p>

I'm using a cronjob that runs every day for both security and lighthouse. But feel free to crawl more often or less :)

Once you've done all the above, you are ready to go.
You can create as many organizations as you'd like. You can add users and you can access all the database from the admin panel.

## Contributions

Please feel free to add any contribution.
If you want to contribute a project that you did, I've documented the code as much as I could.

### Backend 
You can just add a django module and I'll take care of intregrating it in the front. I know how hard it can be :D

### Frontend
I've used React Admin to build the front-end. If you want to help me improve the UI or add new functionnalites. Please feel free to contribute.


## Disclaimers

I'm not a python nor a frontend developer but I'll keep working on it.
